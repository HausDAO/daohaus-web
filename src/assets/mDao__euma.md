RISKS INHERENT TO MARKETINGDAO MEMBERSHIP INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, ALL BUSINESS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY BUSINESS, WITH THE ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRY AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES AND MARKETS. 

IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT CLICK “*I ACCEPT*” AND DO NOT JOIN MARKETINGDAO. 

BY CLICKING “*I ACCEPT*” OR ACCESSING OR USING MARKETINGDAO AS A MEMBER, YOU INDICATE THAT YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS.

All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to in the Operating Agreement (defined below).

**CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP**

This Agreement is an agreement between you and MarketingDAO LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“MarketingDAO” or the “DAO”). 

This Agreement and the Operating Agreement constitute legal, valid, and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting creditor’s rights generally and by general equitable principles.

By entering into this Agreement, you acknowledge and agree that you have sought and obtained all relevant and useful information from MarketingDAO related to its operations and wish to join MarketingDAO as a Member on account of your own determinations and counsel and accept the sufficiency of the terms and exchange of mutual consideration outlined herein.

**MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION AND SUBSCRIPTION TO MARKETINGDAO MEMBER TOKENS**

Your application to join MarketingDAO as a Member and receive Member Tokens shall be subject to the Operating Agreement, a copy of which can be found <*here*> (the “Operating Agreement”), and the membership process defined by MarketingDAO in its Dapp (defined below). 

In the event that your application to join MarketingDAO as a Member is rejected by MarketingDAO, you shall be entitled to receive proposed contributions to the DAO back in full. 

If you are accepted to join MarketingDAO, and you contribute ether, dai, or any other digital asset to the DAO, you hereby subscribe for and agree to purchase the membership units (“Member Tokens”) in MarketingDAO for the aggregate subscription price set forth in MarketingDAO online website or other internet-connected application (the “Dapp”). These Member Tokens represent an interest in MarketingDAO, including the right to vote on internal governance matters and determine distributions of MarketingDAO grants.

The rights and obligations that you receive, in your capacity as a Member of MarketingDAO, are set forth in the Operating Agreement. The closing of the sale and purchase of Member Tokens pursuant to this Agreement shall take place upon the acceptance of digital assets by MarketingDAO through its Dapp from your Ethereum account.

You acknowledge and agree that MarketingDAO may, in its sole discretion and for any reason, elect not to permit you to be a Member of MarketingDAO and that MarketingDAO shall have no liability to you for such outcomes by Member Token Votes or otherwise.

You further agree to execute other documents and instruments as are deemed by MarketingDAO to be appropriate, advisable or necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement or the Operating Agreement.
 
**OPERATING AGREEMENT**

The existing MarketingDAO Members have set out fully in the Operating Agreement their respective rights, obligations and duties with respect to MarketingDAO and related legal interests represented by Member Tokens.

You acknowledge and agree that your participation in MarketingDAO as a Member shall be further governed by the Operating Agreement and that your entry into this Agreement marks your effective assent to such additional terms and conditions upon the successful processing of your MarketingDAO membership application and the minting of Member Tokens for your account by the Members.

(ii) You have all requisite power, authority, and capacity to acquire and hold Member Tokens and to execute, deliver, and comply with the terms of each of the instruments required to be executed and delivered in connection with your subscription for Member Tokens, including this Agreement and the Operating Agreement, and such execution, delivery, and compliance does not conflict with, or constitute a default under, any instruments governing you, or violate any law, regulation, or order, or any agreement or policy to which you are a party or by which you may be bound. 

(iii) If a corporation or other entity, you: (a) are duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of your formation; (b) certify that the person executing and delivering each of such instruments on your behalf has all requisite power, authority, and capacity to execute and deliver such instruments, and, upon request by MarketingDAO or its authorized agent(s), you will furnish to MarketingDAO true and correct copies of your governance instruments, including all amendments to any such instruments; and (c) have authorized by all necessary corporate or other actions, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Operating Agreement, and your performance of the obligations thereunder.

(vi) You understand and acknowledge that you bear the economic risk of this contribution indefinitely and that you have the ability to do so.  

(vii) You further understand and acknowledge that MarketingDAO has no present intention of registering Member Tokens and is under no obligation to register Member Tokens.
